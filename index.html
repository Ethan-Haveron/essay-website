		<p>Jessica hische is a lettering artist,
			 illustrator and author that has done
			  work with the likes of penguin books.
				 On top of this she is also a public
				 speaker that talks at universities
				  and conferences. For example she has
					 done talks at the “American Craft
					 Council” and Lipscomb University
					 about her life and career within
					 lettering. In a treehouse interview,
					  will Jessica she describes lettering
						 as “lettering is a very weird mix of
						  graphic design and illustration”.
							She also describes lettering as
							basically a onetime thing that’s
							specific to the project and the
							 lettering will not be reproduces
							  for other projects.</p>

				 <p>Jessica grew up in Hazelton Pennsylvania,
					  Jessica always wanted to be an artist,
						 she stated in an interview that she
						  “was a kid that just loved to draw
							all day.” Jessica’s parents always
							let her draw because it was a “quiet
							 activity” that kept her busy for
							 long periods of the day. In college
							  Jessica took many subjects within
								art eg fine art, glassblowing, painting.
								 Eventually she found her path after her first design class. </p>

				<p>Jessica didn’t have enough money to
					 buy appealing fonts for her projects
					  in college and she didn’t want to
						 spend ages scrolling through multiple
						  websites looking at boring fonts.
							Jessica thought it would be better
							 if she just created the letters herself.
							  The more she drew the more she noticed
								 her work standing out from the rest of
								  the students in her class. By the end
									 of college Jessica had a sizable amount
									  of lettering work in her portfolio.</p>

										<hr>


	 <p>Jessica managed to land a job
		  working for Louise Fili at the
			 age of 23 from sending out some
			  of her work to many different
				 companies and high up designers
				  in firms including Louise.
					Obviously, she got hardly any
					responses apart from Louise who
					 was open to the idea of bringing in new people.</p>


		<p>From start to finish Jessica was working on
			 lettering for book covers, logos, magazines
			 etc . Jessica still having no knowledge
			 that that’s what she was doing. Jessica
			 just thought that was a part of her
			 illustration and design work.
			  This just shows that there are
				 many levels within design that
				 people do not know about and just
				 accept as graphic design or another
				  term that is widely spread around
					or easier to understand. </p>

				 <p>While Jessica was working for Louise,
					 Jessica was also doing some freelance
					 work on the side. Louise and Jessica worked
					  out an agreement for her to work for her and
						let Jessica do her own thing if it didn’t
						interfere with the work that Jessica is
						doing for Louise. </p>


						<p id="daily">
								She then worked for her for two and a half years
								before going full time as a freelance designer.
								 In an interview, Jessica said that she got more
								  money from her freelance work that what she did
									while working for Louise, also it allowed her to
									get some of her personal time back so she could do her own thing.

	<p>Right after Jessica quit working for Louise,
		she started a project called the daily drop cap,
		 this project that she made for herself was only
		  to make sure that she was drawing letter forms
			 every day. little did she know that this would
			 open many more paths for her career and benefit
			 her greatly overall as a designer and a lettering artist.</p>

			 <p>In this project, Jessica drew a letter a day
				 until she completed 12 alphabets. Jessica posted
				 all her letters to her website for everyone to see.
				  This brought a lot of attention over to her site,
					 to see all these different letters that she has
					 done and to see what she has done in the past etc.
					  Below each post Jessica added a bit of code that
						allowed people to use these drop caps in their own
						 sites, blogs etc. </p>

							<p>This is the time that she
								started to get asked to go to
								different places for talks and
								different public speaking events.</p>

		<p>From this Jessica was given a
			large project from ‘Penguin’ called
			 Penguin Drop Caps. Within this project
			  Jessica was hired to letter design 26
				 book covers each book with a cap that
				  was based on the Author’s last name. </p>

					<p>The designs on these books where not just
						copied over from her original “daily drop cap”
						 project, but each cover was created with this
						  large cap in the centre of the cover with elements
							around it or the elements made the letter depending
							 on the content of the book.</p>

		<p>What a beautiful quote, I can also
			relate to this as I myself do small
			designs when I procrastinate but I
			never realised it until I seen this.
			 I know I should be doing more important
			  things but I like knowing that I’ve made
				 something that I like and that others
				 will also find appealing.</p>

		<p>Lettering and illustration work
			Jessica will always start of with
			pencil sketches</p>

			<p>“My pencils used to be quite rough
				 but because I’ve been doing more and
				  more lettering work for advertising
					 clients, they’ve become more refined.”</p>


		<p>Starting with sketching is not her
			preferred way to work but clients
			 need to approve of the work so far
			  before she can move onto illustration/lettering
				 based programmes.  After the initial sketches,
				  have been approved she then moved over to illustrator
					and recreates the sketch. Jessica doesn’t simply scan
					the sketch in and trace the image, as she feels that
					creating the final piece of work without tracing helps
					her correct any mistakes that she may have made.</p>

					<p id="progress">When Jessica uses illustrator she mainly
						uses the pen tool as she feels that once
						 you master the pen tool you basically master
						 illustrator. While designing Jessica only uses
						  mouse and not a Wacom tablet as she is use to
							practising with a mouse for many years and feels
							 that she works faster with using a mouse.</p>

<section id="dark">

<article>
	<p class="white">Jessica published a book called “in Progress” which is a
		book that shows the process of the design world and
		the creative thinking behind the brain of Jessica hische.
		 The book shows Jessica’s sketches and process in a
		 resource driven fashion, for large clients such as
		 Wes Anderson, NPR and Starbucks.</p>

		 <p class="white">It all started off by ‘chronical’ contacted
			  Jessica and suggested that she show write a
				book, Jessica wanted to do one but didn’t know
				 how to base her skills into a book as she didn’t
				want to create a monograph book (combination of life’s work).</p>

			<p class="white">
				Her first thought on the book was to create a
				book that showed the process of some of her work,
				 from the initial sketch to the finish product.
				  As she further worked with the publishers the
					 book went from a process to a resource style
					  book. Over time she realised that this book
						 was a very important thing (more that she
						 first thought) so Jessica wanted to make it
						  as resourceful and dense as possible for readers.
							 The booked changed from 5-10 thousand words,
							  which was just her own notes beside her designs
								 etc to 30-40 thousand words that goes more in
								 depth about the information shown on each page.

		<p>Today Jessica divides her very intensive lifestyle
			between Brooklyn and San Francisco with her husband
			and child. Jessica also runs her studio and has a
			workshop area for people to learn different skills
			 within lettering and design. </p>

			 <p>When she isn’t working, she is “Procrastiworking”
				 Jessica always uses her free time with side projects,
				  usually web based projects, such as ‘how to use Twitter’
					 and a website to share knowledge that she has picked up.
					  When she isn’t doing any type of working Jessica likes
						 to spend time with friends and family like every other
						  person, Jessica also spends time travelling to different
							 conferences and doing public speaking talking about her
							  life so far.</p>
